# Overview
Provides a report addressing the following questions:

```text
Justification for your refactoring decisions.
The challenges you would have faced maintaining and testing the original monolithic code.
How you would modify your refactored code to handle a custom-sized tic-tac-toe game (larger than 3x3), and how this implementation would be easier to handle than in the original code.
```

## Justification

I refactored the code into classes because ... ... it provides the following benefits:

1. benefit
2. benefit
3. benefit

Without the refactoring, the code would have faced the following challenges:
1. challenge
2. challenge

## Handling Custom-Sized Tic-Tac-Toe

My implementation can handle custom sizes because:
1. reason
2. reason
3. reason

On the other hand, the original code could not handle custom sizes because:
1. reason
2. reason
3. reason

## Conclusion

The activity allowed me to practice refactoring and to understand the benefits of object-oriented programming. I learned that ... ... and I will apply this knowledge in future projects.
