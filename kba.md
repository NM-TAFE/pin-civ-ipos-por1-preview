My answer is such and such....

3. How would you explain Python's parameter-passing mechanism? Is it more similar to pass-by-value or pass-by-reference? Justify your answer.

4. Given the following Python code, what will be the output and why?

    ```python
    def modify_list(list_):
        list_.append("new")
        list_ = ["completely", "new"]

    items = ["original"]
    modify_list(items)
    print(items)
    ```


5. In Python, even though variables created within a function are local, there are still situations where you can modify data outside the scope with a local variable. Explain this anomaly and relate it to both mutability and pass by reference.


6. List two benefits of modular coding approaches. How do these benefits assist in the development of medium-sized applications?
